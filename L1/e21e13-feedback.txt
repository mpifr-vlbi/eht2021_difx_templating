Slack #mpifr-l1
7 June 2022 12:52 CET [Sebastiano von Fellenberg] @Jan Wagner here is a short summary of what we discussed in the meeting today:
e21e13:
 - KT band has something weird going on in a central band (2.291e5MHz) both in phase
   and in amplitude of the RR correlation. The amplitude drops, and the phase is wrapped 180 degrees.
 - AX has a weird linear drop in amplitude of RR and LL in the two left most bands,
   the phases as well as AXAX autocorrelation are not affected.
   I showed it to Alan Roy, but he did not know any obvious reason.
   His best hunch was that the digital OCT-filter might cause a roll-off filtering.
   Michael found that  in the 2017 data, AX showed a similar slope, but it only affected one of the correlations (RR).
 - SW has some residual phase slopes, probably due to poor bandpass calibration.
   To confirm that I am running the pipeline again without bandpass calibration (takes time).
   The report in 3C273_scan68_plots.ps shows all three effects.
 - Overall calibration looks  okay (delay, rates and data quality), see SUMMARY_delay,* pdf.
 - GL baselines are however fairly poor, large phase noise see the attached screen shot from difmap
   'GL 4 spw with poorly calibrated delay, symptom: RL, LR cross hands have large wraps in outcorrleation.'
