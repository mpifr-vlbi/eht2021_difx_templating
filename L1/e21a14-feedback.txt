9 June 2022 15:53 CET [Sebastiano von Fellenberg] e21a14 is now done
you can find the products here: l1/software-dev/products_e21a14/

things i noticed when looking through the diagnostics:

SCAN22_3C279:  <JanW note: 104-0255>
 - KT-KT has RR 2.921e5 MHz band problem, drop in amplitude and phase warp - same as in e21e13
 - NN-NN has RR 2.288e5 MHz band problem, drop in amplitude and phase warp - same symptom as KT-KT
 - unlike in e21e13, AX does not have the linear drop-off
SCAN81_J1924-2914:
 - KT-KT same problem
 - overall not too great SNR, AA-AX ~ 10-20 degree phase noise
SCAN66_J1924-2914:
 - KT-KT same problem
 - SNR better, AA-AX ~1-5 degree phase noise, detection on other baselines as well
SCAN48_J1743-0350:
 - KT-KT same problem
 - NN-NN same problem
SCAN70-SGRA:
 - SZ-SZ has linear slopes in amplitudes in the edge bands in LL (lowest band), RR (highest band)
   (phase seems poorly calibrated: MG-AA, KT-MG)
 - in all scans with KT-KT which I eyeballed, KT-KT seems have a slightly disturbed amplitudes in
   the highest frequency band. We attributed this to RFI in e21e13, but given that it is reoccurring probably not?

For SGRA scans data looks quite good already.
The KT "amplitude and phase problem" from e21e13 reappeared.
Similar symptom spotted in NT, but in different band.

19:15 CET [Jan Wagner] The e21a14 "SCAN22_3C279" is probably 104-0255?
Erratic L-R amplitude  Kt-Kt from ~229.100 GHz, HOPS channel q,
   " fourfit -ptx -bKK -m1 -PRR 104-0255 set freqs q "
there is indeed a curious spike there.
