# Track e21f19 band 4
# Notes:
#  - Pico has 5-9G (rather than 4-8G) IF filters and shifted 1st LO by +1 GHz,
#    hence Pico b1 b2 are fine, b3 is absent, and b4 is covered by
#    the 5-9G IF "b3"-equivalent data found on recorder3
#  - NOEMA b4 module (rec3) contained no recordings from e21f29, got b1 only
#  - Clk scans ALMA-Pico 109-0219, ALMA-SMTO 109-0450, ALMA-JCMT 109-0555
#  - No fringes in b4 to GLT nor SMA, not even SMA-JCMT
